	<h2>Usability heuristics </h2>
<h3>Match With The Real World</h3>
<p>Match with the real world is using familiar icons or concepts. This includes putting information in a natural, familiar place. And following real world conventions.
</p>
<h3>User control and freedom</h3>
<p>User control and freedom means providing users with control over the  programme that they are using, and make it easy for them to undo/redo, cancel or even something as simple as going back to a previous page with one click.
</p>
<h3>Flexibility & Efficiency of Use</h3>
<p>Flexibility and efficiency of use heuristic principle is about giving your users ways to speed up their work with more efficiency and flexibility.
</p>
<h3>Diagnose and Recover From Errors</h3>
<p>This heuristic can help people to diagnose an error they might have intentionally or unintentionally done like accidentally switching the internet off and can help them to recover from these errors like a fix or place they could go to to fix the problem.
</p>
<h3>Consistency and Standards</h3>
<p>Follow design conventions and standards to avoid confusing users. An example of twould be that green always means yes and red always means cancel or no. If buttons were coloured in reverse it could be confusing. Also, making sure that the same symbols or words represent the same things where ever you use them makes your website more consistent
</p>
<h3>Error Prevention</h3>
<p>Error prevention is stopping the user from making an error/mistake. You can do this by having a warning or not give the user the ability to click on the button, by greying it out or locking it.
</p>

<h2> Relevant Implication </h2>
<h3>Social</h3>
<p>Social is about not offending any groups, gender, social classes and ages</p>
<h3>Cultural</h3>
<p>Is about not excluding/offending any religious/rthinic/cultural groups</p>
<h3>Legal</h3>
<p>Is about not breaking any laws and following them, like fair trading act and copyright. It is important to follow the laws otherwise the site can be shut down</p>
<h3>Ethical</h3>
<p>Is about not having any unethical images or actions on the website, like using milk when the person says that they are gluten free</p>
<h3>Intellectual property</h3>
<p>It is about photos that are owned by another and there are also laws in place. It is important to follow these rules as it could break the law and is unethical and would most likely shut the page down</p>
<h3>Privacy</h3>
<p>Is about not sharing a user data without them knowing or having agreed to it</p>
<h3>Accessibility</h3>
